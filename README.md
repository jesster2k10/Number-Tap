# Number Tap

## Development

This app was developed in 2016 and was one of my first real world applications.
It was built using **Swift 2.0** , **SpriteKit** and **CocoaPods**.

As one of my first projects, there was a lot I had done wrong and a lot I learned from it. If I were to remake this today, there is a lot I would've done differently.
Some of my shortfalls were:

- The lack of testing
- Inconsistent architecture
- Repetitive, non DRY code
- MVC (Massive View Controllers).

The project never went live officially and the source code has remained close source until now (August 2020). It was a great learning experience and I applied most of my knowledge from it to my future endeavours.

Some of the things I learned while working on this project are:

- The importance of architecture in software development. My current projects are all built with a specific architecture in mind. My most popular choice when working with Swift is either MVVM + RxSwift, Redux (with SwiftUI) or Viper (with UIKit)
- Seperation of concerns: A lot of the code in this project is duplicated, and could easily be refactored in to re-usable functions and classes
- How to setup in app purchases with receipt validation
- Basic data structures and algorithims
- The basics of game development.
